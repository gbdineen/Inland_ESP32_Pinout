GitHub user @natedogg2020 did an amazing solid for all of us and made a pinout chart of this board. But I wanted to be able to easily compare the pinouts on the Inland version to others when watching how-tos, and pretty much everyone shows their pinouts with the chip at the top and the micro USB at the bottom, so I did a new version showing the board oriented that way to make it a little easier to compare to other boards.
